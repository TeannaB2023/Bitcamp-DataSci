## üìù Teaching this course
We aim to provide students with the **tools, skills, and experience** to work with with data science. Those three componenets break down as such for you, the teachers of the course:

### Tools: content delivery üì¶
This component should be mostly handled for you, as the content of the course has been previously developed. Please familiarize yourself with the python notebooks and the high-level purposes of the libraries covered, as that is what the questions will be mostly about as your run this camp. See Course Format and Curriculum below.


### Skills: prompt asking questions üé£
Students will likely struggle if they are not familiar with the interface, the language, and the libraries. This is to be expected. The key to turning confusion into learnings in our context here is coupling their goal to accomplish the tasks with the implementation details and design. If they tell you they are stuck or can't answer a question, ask them to clarify exactly what they're trying to do, and point them to the right example or search query to address that disconnect. Providing them the answer to their question does not help nearly as much as showing them how to answer their own question


### Experience: hands-off guidance üôå
Once the students are comfortable following the motions of the content and are able to ask good questions about how and why things work or are designed in a certain way, you can start asking them to do more. "I see you wrote it this way, whould there be another way to do that with less code?" and other kids of open-ended questions are good to ask students in the final weeks and in office hour sessions. The students should have the ability to continue working on Data Science after the bootcamp, and you can help them do that by guiding them on their own problem-solving journeys and projects to explore. Providing concrete details is okay if it's done in order to guide the studetns: I know this other data set that might be fun to work with, this is another project online you might find interesting, etc.



## Course Format
Our curriculum is centered around two types of categories:

**Tutorials** are guided, step-by-step tutorials to teach concepts and technical skills. These will be video recordings with open Q&A, and they will cover the technical skills needed for the labs. These will be provided with an accompanying python notebook that should have the "Now Try This" sections completed.

**Labs** are self-directed assignments given between each set of tutorials to cement and test your knowledge, as well as give you some more flexibility in what you're doing with the data. For example, we will provide a dataset and perform some operations during the tutorial, but you may have another question about the data that you can answer yourself with what you've learned that week.

## üåê About BitProject

The Bit community is powered by collaboration. We believe learning is more fun ‚Äî and more effective ‚Äî when we put our heads together.

### Who we are üëã
We are passionate students from all walks of life who come together to making tech education accessible.

Our mission is to provide students the tools and connections they need to unleash their potential in tech.

### Our Values üèÖ
We believe in democratizing tech education. Everyone should have access to quality resources, opportunities, and networks regardless of their background.

At Bit Project, we strive to create an environment where all people are welcomed, members are engaged, and backgrounds are celebrated.

We welcome everyone, regardless of age, race, class, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual identity, ability, size, nationality, culture, faith, neurotype and background.

### Chapter structure üéì
We want to build a chapter **community** around our leaders and content. This means that at every appropriate opportunity, reaching out to younger or less experienced students is the *right thing to do*.

If you happened to have a good opportunity working somewhere or with somebody, pass that experience along to the group, bringing those learnings to everybody. This not only benefits others, but it builds a more supportive, trusting organization where you can learn from others the same way they learned from you.
