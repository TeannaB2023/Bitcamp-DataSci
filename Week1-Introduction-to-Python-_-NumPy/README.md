## Recap
By this point we have looked into some important steps such as:
- What is Data? And it's relevance in our mordern era.
- Understanding data science and its scope and role in the world.
- A general outline of what you will be learning throughout this curriculum.

## Learning Objectives
For this week, we will learn the basics of Python and creating basic programs. By the end of the week you wil be able to do the following:
- Recognize and be comfortable with Python syntax.
- Code along with an example and run a Python application.
- Be familiar with key Python data structures and associated methods.
- Understand functions and their use cases.
- Have a solid grasp of errors and exception handling.
- Be familar with modules and how to import them into your program.

## About Python

Python, which was introduced by Guido van Rossum as a Christmas project, has quickly escalated to become one of the most popular languages of all times. Rossum had an idea in mind â€” overcome the shortcomings of other programming languages and introduce a language which is simple and easy to read. Rossum also came up with a short and mysterious name Python after the British comedy group Monty Python. 

Python is a very popular scripting language that you can use to create applications and programs of all sizes and complexity. It is very easy to learn and has very little syntax, making it very efficient to code with. Python is also the language of choice for many when performing comprehensive data analysis.

### Non-Tech People Are Now Learning Python
We have written a lot about how Python has a neat and easy syntax making it quite likeable amid the data science community. The constructs of this language make it easier for a non-technical person to grab it and is definitely one of the easiest programming languages to learn. Even the learners from a non-technical background are taking a liking to the language. 


### Why Python Wins
While Python may not be perfect, it has some great features that make it a good common language. For instance, the language in syntactically concise, easy to fiddle with data, customise behaviour at a deeper level, among others. Here are some of the reasons that makes Python a widespread language and a favourite of non-technical people.
