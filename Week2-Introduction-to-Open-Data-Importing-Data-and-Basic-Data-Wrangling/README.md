# Introduction to Data Manipulation with Pandas

## Recap
Last week, we have covered the following concepts in Python:
- Strings
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- ...

## Learning Objectives
For this week, we will focus on the data manipulation using Pandas. Pandas is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming. Since we are familiar with the basic concepts in Python, it should be easier to understand the syntax and data structures we use in this tutorial. 

By the end of the week, you wil be able to implement the following functions in Pandas Dataframe:

- Importing data
- Setting an index
- Getting info about the dataset
- Removing NaN (None) values
- Selecting subsets of data
- Filtering dataset based on criteria
- Aggregation functions

## About the Libraries
### Pandas

Pandas stands for **Python Data Analysis Library**. Pandas is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool and it is widely used both in academia and industry. It is built on top of the Python programming language and it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.


## About the Dataset 
### Titanic Dataset

To begin with Pandas and dataframes, we will use a dataset about the Titanic. Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died.

Using Pandas data manipulation, we will figure out the survival rates by different groups and the correlation between the survival rate and another column in the dataset.



## For further assistance

If you would like to learn more about Pandas dataframe, here's the resource you can refer to. Pandas Dataframe API is a library where all of the functions and properties in Pandas are available.
